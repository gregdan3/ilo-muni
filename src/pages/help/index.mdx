This page is about **how to use and understand ilo Muni**, which you can work
through like a tutorial or a manual. If you want to know how or why ilo Muni
exists, or want to talk to me, [see the about page!](/about)

There's also a quick reference under the <Icon name="mingcute:question-line" />
help button on the main page, and
[a section for frequently asked questions.](#frequently-asked-questions)

## Table of Contents

## Search

### Words

Search for a **[toki pona word](https://linku.la/)** such as
[**pona**](/?query=pona). If it appeared at least 40 times across all the places
and times I checked, you'll get a graph showing how that word has been used over
time! By default, you'll see what percentage of all words were the searched word
with monthly datapoints.

You can also search for proper names like [**Sonko**](/?query=sonko),
[**Inli**](/?query=inli), or [**Siko**](/?query=Siko). There are lots of very
rare words in the database too. You might be surprised by what you find, so try
lots of things!

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- See the start and growth of words coined only a few years ago like
  [**tonsi**](/?query=tonsi) or [**misikeke**](/?query=misikeke)
- Explore the use of rarer words like [**majuna**](/?query=majuna),
  [**linluwi**](/?query=linluwi), or [**kiki**](/?query=kiki)

</details>

### Terms

You can search for **up to 6 words in one term**, such as
[**mi kama sona e toki pona**](/?query=mi+kama+sona+e+toki+pona). Note that the
more words are in a term, the fewer times it is likely to appear- so don't be
surprised if you don't get a result. Try searching for shorter terms, like
[**kama pona**](/?query=kama+pona) or [**anu seme**](/?query=anu+seme).

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Watch the rising popularity of terms like [**kin la**](/?query=kin+la)
- Watch terms come and go over time as the things they reference do, like
  [**tenpo pana**](/?query=tenpo+pana&smoothing=0),
  [**tenpo monsuta**](/?query=tenpo+monsuta&smoothing=0), or
  [**suno pi toki pona**](/?query=suno+pi+toki+pona&smoothing=0)
- Examine the use of grammatical features like
  [**kepeken e**](/?query=kepeken+e)

</details>

### Multiple Searches

You can graph **multiple terms at once** by separating them with commas `,`. You
can even mix different lenght terms on one graph:
[**toki, pona, toki pona**](/ilo-muni?query=toki,+pona,+toki+pona). Often,
different terms will have very different amounts of use, resulting in it being
hard to read more than the top one or two graphs. You can address that with
[logarithmic](#logarithmic) or [minmax](#minmax) scales seen later in this
tutorial.

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Compare former synonyms like [**lukin, oko**](/?query=lukin,+oko)
- See the close relationship between similar words like
  [**pan, kili**](/?query=pan,+kili) or
  [**laso, loje, jelo, walo, pimeja**](/?query=laso,+loje,+jelo,+walo,+pimeja)
- Compare the modifiers that appear after specific words, like
  [**wawa a, wawa mute, wawa lili, wawa suli, wawa sewi**](/?query=wawa+a,+wawa+mute,+wawa+lili,+wawa+suli,+wawa+sewi)
- Examine how people talk about their skill in toki pona with
  [**sona toki pona, sona e toki pona, sona pi toki pona**](/?query=sona+toki+pona,+sona+e+toki+pona,+sona+pi+toki+pona)
- Compare greetings over time, like
  [**sina seme, sina pali e seme**](/?query=sina+seme,+sina+pali+e+seme)
- See how popular Sonja's books are with [**pu, ku, su**](/?query=pu,+ku,+su)

</details>

### Wildcard

You can search for **multiple similar terms** by replacing **one word in a
term** with a wildcard `*`. This will search for the **ten most popular terms**
that match your search and graph them. Note that you may only use one wildcard
per search term, and you cannot start a term with a wildcard.

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Estimate the most popular prepositional phrases for "tawa":
  [**tawa \***](suli:4321/ilo-muni?query=tawa+*)
- Observe the disparity in the top 1-2 uses of a word versus the rest:
  [**sona \***](/ilo-muni?query=sona+*), [**ona \***](/ilo-muni?query=ona+*)

</details>

### Adding terms

You can **add terms together** by putting a `+` between them. This is helpful
for combining synonyms, like [**ale + ali**](/?query=ale+%2B+ali). You can also
use it to compare multiple related words to another one, like
[**pan + kili, moku**](/?query=pan+%2B+kili,+moku).

It often helps to graph some or all of the summed terms separately from the sum
so you can see how much the graph has been shifted by the sum, such as in
[**pan + kili, moku, pan, kili**](/?query=pan+%2B+kili,+moku,+pan,+kili)

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- See what portion of toki pona is pure particles:
  [**li, e, la, pi, o, en, anu**](/?query=li+%2B+e+%2B+la+%2B+pi+%2B+o+%2B+en+%2B+anu)
- Combine multiple ways to write the same word, like
  [**ala + x**](/?query=ala+%2B+x) or
  [**anu + y, anu, y**](/?query=anu+%2B+y,+anu,+y)
- Do that with UCSUR text specifically: [**toki + 󱥬**](/?query=toki+%2B+󱥬)
- Combine related words to compare to others:
  [**a + n, pona**](/?query=a+%2B+n,+pona)

</details>

**Note**: If you're currently viewing the **authors** or **hits per author**
field, adding terms is disabled.

### Subtracting terms

You can **subtract terms from other terms** by putting a `-` between them. This
is helpful when you'd like to omit a specific use of a word, such as in
[**toki - toki pona**](/?query=toki+-+toki+pona). This gives you all the uses of
the word "toki" which are not in the term "toki pona".

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Determine what grammatical positions a term is most common in:
  [**tenpo ni - tenpo ni la - lon tenpo ni, tenpo ni**](/?query=tenpo+ni+-+tenpo+ni+la+-+lon+tenpo+ni,+tenpo+ni)
- Examine the use of a word without other conflicting terms, like in
  [**san - kekan san**](/?query=san+-+kekan+san)

</details>

**Note**: If you're currently viewing the **authors** or **hits per author**
field, subtracting terms is disabled.

{/*
### Minimum Sentence Length

You can **set a minimum sentence length** for a term by adding an underscore `_`
and a number from 1 to 6 **to the end of that term**. For example,
[**toki_1, toki_6**](/?query=toki,+toki_6) will show you the percentage of times
toki appeared in any sentence, versus the smaller percentage of times that it
was in specifically sentences of length 6. You can do this with any length of
term: [**ona li, ona li_6**](/?query=ona+li,+ona+li_6)

You can use this with subtraction to **isolate a term**: Searching
[**toki - toki_2**](/?query=toki+-+toki_2) will show you every time "toki"
appeared, except for the times it appeared in sentences with 2 or more words.
This means means you have all the times "toki" was the only word in the
sentence!

Read ahead to the options section on
[minimum sentence length](#minimum-sentence-length-1) for more details.

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Get even more accurate information about greetings:
  [**sina seme - sina seme_3, sina pali e seme - sina pali e seme_5**](/?query=sina+seme+-+sina+seme_3,+sina+pali+e+seme+-+sina+pali+e+seme_5)
- See if there is a difference in relative use of words:
  [**toki, pona, toki_6, pona_6**](/?query=toki,+pona,+toki_6,+pona_6). (there
  is! "pona" is more common in short sentences; "toki" is more common in long
  sentences!)

## Scales

On the search page, this dropdown offers many different scales you can graph the
data on:

<CategorizedDropdown
  id="scaleDropdown"
  options={SCALES}
  selected={defaultScale}
/>

The categories in the dropdown ("simple", "useful", and "weird") indicate the
importance of the scale to you- if you're not interested in the details, then
stick to the simple category and you'll be fine! Otherwise, read on.

Beyond the categories, you'll note there are four types of scale listed:
**Linear**, **Logarithmic**, **Minmax**, and **Other**. I'll go over each in
detail below.

### Linear

The linear scales will be the most familiar and obvious. They include the
[absolute](#absolute), [relative](#relative), and [cumulative](#cumulative)
scales, and in each, you have a series of exact numbers which are graphed over
time without changing the left axis or the magnitude of the numbers- this means
the visual distance from 10 to 20 will be the same as the distance from 20 to
30, and so on. In other words, this is how graphs normally work!

### Logarithmic

The logarithmic scales squish all the data on the graph closer together by
rendering every power of ten at the same size. This means that the visual
distance from 10 to 100 will be the same as the visual distance from 100 to
1,000, and so on for 1,000 to 10,000 and beyond.

The benefit of this is that you can visually compare two graphs that a linear
scale could not, because the graphs would be drawn closer together. On a linear
scale, a word with 10,000 monthly uses would make a word with only 100 monthly
uses essentially invisible,
[which you can see here](/ilo-muni?query=toki%2C+selo&scale=abs). On the
logarithmic scale though, the trend line of the less common word
[becomes visible](/ilo-muni?query=toki%2C+selo&scale=logabs), letting you see
that it still trends the same way as the much more popular word!

Another benefit of the logarithmic scale is that the original data, and
therefore the original ordering of the data, is preserved. For example, in the
**relative log scale**,
[kijetesantakalu, soweli](/?query=kijetesantakalu,+soweli&scale=logrel) are much
closer together while not errantly implying that kijetesantakalu exceeded soweli
in popularity as the equivalent
[minmax scale](/?query=kijetesantakalu,+soweli&scale=normrel) would.

### Minmax

For example, the **Relative Minmax scale** normalizes all the points in the
**relative** graph to be between 0 and 1 while preserving the original curve of
the graph. This is excellent for demonstrating that words like
[**ona, li**](/?query=ona%2C+li&scale=normrel) trend similarly with use while
being in different magnitudes.

The **Absolute Minmax scale** normalizes all the points in the **absolute**
graph to be between 0 and 1 while preserving the original curve of the graph.
This makes it helpful for demonstrating that
[**toki, meli**](/?query=toki,+meli&scale=normabs) trend similarly with
community activity while being in different mangitudes. This even applies
[when comparing words and phrases](/?query=toki,+pona,+wawa+mute&scale=normabs).

## Fields

On the search page, this drop down gives you access to different types of data
to graph:

<CategorizedDropdown
  id="fieldDropdown"
  options={FIELDS}
  selected={defaultField}
/>

### Hits

**Hits** are the default graphed data, and represent the number of times a word
or phrase appeared per month. There are no filters on this, aside from what is
considered a "toki pona sentence" by my library,
[sona toki](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-toki/tree/main/src/sonatoki). If
you'd like to test that library out, there's a slightly more strict version of
it implemented in my bot **ilo pi toki pona taso**, which can be found in many
toki pona Discord servers.

#### Absolute

**Hits** on the **absolute scale** shows the exact number of times a given word
or phrase was said in each time period. This is useful for observing
[trends in the activity of the community](/?query=li+%2B+mi+%2B+e+%2B+ni+%2B+la+%2B+toki+%2B+pona+%2B+lon+%2B+ala+%2B+sina&scale=abs),
but can make it difficult to compare words which are
[of very different magnitude](/?query=a,+kin&scale=abs), or to study the use of
toki pona
[before March 2020](/?query=toki,+pona,+toki+pona&scale=abs&start=1438387200&end=1564617600).

If you're interested in comparing two or more absolute graphs, but one word is
vastly more popular than the others, check again using the
[logarithmic](#logarithmic) or [minmax](#minmax) scales.

#### Relative

The **relative scale** is the default scale, and when graphing **hits** on it,
it shows you the **percentage of all words** which are the searched term in each
time period on the graph. This also applies to phrases, for which you would
interpret as follows: "What portion of all words are **any one word** from this
phrase?" This is to say, the number of times a phrase appears can stand in for
any of the words in the phrase, from a math standpoint.

If you're interested in **why** I do the math this way, you can read about it in
the discussion below. Spoiler: I dunk on Google, who admits they are doing their
math incorrectly.

<details>
<summary>**Discussion**</summary>

The challenge of doing appropriate math with the different term lengths is that
you can derive different reasonable percentages for the same term. My goal is to
offer a percentage which matches users' assumptions as often as possible, and
particularly, makes sense when adding or subtracting terms. In other words, I
intend to follow the
[principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).

There are three questions we could ask of the data to derive a reasonable
percentage, and I'll explore each with the following simplified dataset:

- There are 10,000 words in total
- There are 9,000 terms of length 2
- The word "toki" appears 100 times
- The word "pona" appears 100 times
- The phrase "toki pona" appears 90 times

Here are the percentages that result from this data:

- **toki** is **1%** of all words. (100 / 10000)
- **pona** is **1%** of all words. (100 / 10000)
- **toki pona** is **1%** of all terms of length 2. (90 / 9000)
- **toki pona** is **1.8%** of all words when you count it for each of its
  words. ((90 \* 2) / 10000)
- **toki pona** is **0.9%** of all words when you count it as a word itself. (90
  / 10000)

---

1. **What percentage of all same-length terms are this term?**

This method seems to work at first, because we know that the total number of
terms of a given length (9,000 terms of length 2) can be compared to the number
of a specific term of that length (90 times that "toki pona" appears). The
problem with this method is that the resultant percentage is not comparable to
the percentage you would derive for terms of different lengths.

In the sample data, **toki** is **1%** of all words, and the phrase **toki
pona** is **1%** of all terms of length 2. If we perform the search **toki -
toki pona**, the result would be **0%** ((100 / 10000) - (90 / 9000)). To a
user, this would imply that all of the occurrences of **toki** were in the
phrase **toki pona**, which they are not.

Under this method, there isn't a way to compare "toki" and "toki pona" because
their percentages are measured against unrelated totals: "percentage of all
words" is not comparable to "percentage of all phrases of length 2", and
percentages of each cannot be meaningfully added or subtracted. Doing math as
though they are comparable will create confusing and incorrect results as we
observed.

Strangely,
[Google Ngrams does this intentionally according to their info page](https://books.google.com/ngrams/info),
in spite of the fact that they allow you to add and subtract n-grams of
different length. Direct quote, with bold added by me:

> What the y-axis shows is this: **of all the bigrams** [terms of length 2] contained
> in our sample of books written in English and published in the United States, **what
> percentage of them** are "nursery school" or "child care"?

All that said, **this method is still useful.** It produces a sensible result on
its own, still lets you do valid math on two or more terms with the same length,
and can help you infer useful things about the distribution of terms in the
language you're studying. But it does not work for my purposes, because it is
necessary for a user to be able to compare terms with different lengths and get
a valid result.

If you're interested in this alternate math, I provide totals for every phrase
length in ilo Muni's database, so
[download the database](https://gregdan3.com/sqlite/2024-11-29-trimmed.sqlite.gz)
to try it!

2. **What percentage of all words are in this term?**

For graphing a single term with two or more words, you can get interesting and
meaningful results from this question. To do this, we would multiply the number
of times the phrase occurred by the length of the phrase, then divide by the
total number of words. This means that, percentage-wise, each phrase counts for
all of its words.

In the sample data, we would count the phrase **toki pona** as **1.8%** of all
words, because the phrase **toki pona** occurs 90 times and has 2 words in it
((90 \* 2) / 10000). However, what happens when we attempt to subtract with this
total?

Let's look at **toki - toki pona** again, but without the percentages for a
moment. **toki** is counted once for each time it occurs, times the number of
words in it, so it has 100 occurrences. **toki pona** is counted once for each
time it occurs, times the number of words in it, so it has **180** occurrences.
But this also means that we're attributing 90 of those occurrences to **toki**
in the phrase, and the other 90 occurrences to **pona** in the same phrase.

This is where the math falls apart: We're removing occurrences of "pona" from
occurrences of "toki", because the phrase "toki pona" counts for both of its
words. But there were never any occurrences of "pona" in the occurrences of
"toki", so we would get a lower result than expected- in this case, the math
works out to **-0.9%** ((100 - (90 \* 2)) / 10,000), which is an even worse
result than before and likely doesn't mean anything to a user.

3. **What percentage of all words are any word in this phrase?**

In this method, we take the number of times a given phrase occurred, regardless
of its length, and divide it by the total number of words. This seems incorrect
on the surface, for similar reasons to the first method: Aren't we doing math
with incomparable totals? But let's continue with this method and see where it
goes.

In this method, we use a single total number of words (10,000) and we do not
need to alter the occurrences for a term based on its length- which means this
method is actually the simplest to calculate. With this, the search **toki -
toki pona** works out to **0.1%** ((100 - 90) / 10000). That looks like a
sensible result, but what does it mean?

In the prior scenario, we explored the phrase being counted for each of its
words, which we accomplished by multiplying its number of occurrences by its
number of words. We also noted that this is equivalent to counting its words
independently, such that the phrase **toki pona** being counted 180 times means
that the words **toki** and **pona** occur 90 times each, in the phrase **toki
pona**.

In this scenario, the term **toki pona** is only counted for how many times it
appeared. This means, in the subtraction example, we can imagine the 90
occurrences of **toki pona** as applying to either word in the phrase-
contextually! This means you would interpret that **0.1%** figure as meaning
"**toki** which is not in the phrase **toki pona** is what percentage of all
words?"

Relatedly, the fact that the search is possible to interpret contextually means
we can perform another similar serach and get a valid result: If we search for
**pona - toki pona**, the result is **0.1%** ((100 - 90) / 10000) and still
makes sense: "**pona** which is not in the phrase **toki pona** is what
percentage of all words?"

Even better, you can replicate the prior method by subtracting a phrase once for
each word in it. If we did want to remove every word in **toki pona** from
**toki** we can search **toki - toki pona - toki pona** to get that result.

---

Last note: If you're a math academic reading this, I am terribly, terribly sorry
for not using real notation to demonstrate the above. I assure you, these plain
language explanations are much less embarassing than any attempt I would make to
use set notation.

</details>

The relative scale is the most generally useful scale, as it implicitly tells
you the relationship of your search term to all other terms by showing a
percentage instead of a raw number. For example, you can compare
[the grammatical particles](/?query=li,+e,+la,+o,+a&scale=rel) or
[the colors](/?query=laso%2C+loje%2C+jelo%2C+walo%2C+pimeja&scale=rel),
determining how much of the entire language is these terms.

It can be difficult to compare relative graphs for words which are in different
magnitudes, such as
[kijetesantakalu, soweli](/?query=kijetesantakalu%2C+soweli&scale=rel). I
recommend the [Relative Minmax scale](#minmax) for cases like these, which can
help to identify words which trend in the same way no matter their magnitude.

#### Cumulative

When graphing hits on the **cumulative scale**, you'll see how many times a
given word has been said up to a point in time, increasing to the total number
of times the word has been said by the present. This is handy for
[observing the point where a word or phrase becomes more spoken than another](/?query=sina+seme,+sina+pali+e+seme&scale=cmsum),
or
[differently examining periodic phrases](/?query=suno+pi+toki+pona&minSentLen=1&scale=cmsum).
It can also help to clarify the fact that, while one word has become more
popular than another [recently](/?query=kokosila%2C+penpo&scale=rel), it may not
have done so [all-time](/?query=kokosila,+penpo&scale=cmsum)

### Authors

**Authors** is the number of **unique** users who said a given word or phrase
during a month. This is further filtered by the fact that an author must have
said **at least 20 toki pona sentences** in order to be counted, which is done
to make sure that the counted authors are only those who have spent at least a
bit of time actually practicing toki pona. Without this limit, a very large
number of authors would be counted among the crowd despite not using almost any
of toki pona's words, which would errantly reduce the portion of authors who
have used a critical word like **toki**.

Also, because this is the number of **unique** authors, it is not possible to
add or subtract authors or use the **cumulative** scale, and so adding and
subtracting terms will not show any data. This is not possible because the
database only has the strict number of authors per data point, not the authors
themselves- and you need the authors themselves, because this is actually a
**set operation**. Here's an example:

Let's say the word **toki** has been said by `{A, B, C, D}`, and the phrase
**toki pona** has been said by `{A, E}`. In the current database, I store just
the size of each set, so **toki** has been said by 4 authors, and **toki pona**
has been said by 2 authors. If I wanted to know how many authors said **toki**
outside of the phrase **toki pona**, the correct math would be `{A, B, C, D}` -
`{A, E}` = `{B, C, D}`, or 3 authors. That is, we remove `A` from
`{A, B, C, D}`, but we don't do anything with `E` because it wasn't in the prior
set to be removed.

Now, the issue should be obvious: If we only had the number of authors without
knowing who the original authors were, we would remove the 2 authors of **toki
pona** from the 4 authors of **toki** and get 2 authors. But we already know
this is incorrect.

I'm considering a new database backend which would let me do the set math when
performing such a query, but for the time being that cannot be done.

### Hits per Author

#### Absolute

On the absolute graph, **hits per author** is the average number of hits per
author, graphed over time. For example, if there were 100 authors, and 1,000
hits for the word **toki**, then the hits per author would be 10 (10 / 1000).

#### Relative

On the relative graph, **hits per author** is the **percentage of the language**
which is made up of the average author saying a given word.

## Other Options

### Smoothing

<IntDropdown
  id="smoothingDropdown"
  options={SMOOTHINGS}
  selected={defaultSmoothing}
  pluralText=" smoothing"
/>

By default, **2 smoothing** is set. The number is how many neighbors **on both
sides** of a given data point will be smoothed. For example, if you set **5
smoothing** with the **Window Avg** smoother, it means a given point will be set
to the average of the 5 points before, 5 points after, and itself.

Smoothing is helpful for making noisy graphs more readable while preserving the
trend line of the original graph. Compare the graphs of **wawa, nasa, suwi,
sewi, suli** with
[**0 smoothing**](/?query=wawa,+nasa,+suwi,+sewi,+suli&smoothing=0) and
[**5 smoothing**](/?query=wawa,+nasa,+suwi,+sewi,+suli&smoothing=5). Tip: Double
check the axis on the left!

Note that smoothing can produce misleading graphs with respect to the time axis,
such as
[**smearing periodic phrases over too much time**](/?query=tenpo+pana&smoothing=10).
Sometimes, **0 smoothing** is better!

Relatedly, some [scales](#scales) have smoothing disabled, usually because it
wouldn't make sense to average their values. This applies to the **absolute**
scale, for example, because it is meant to show you the exact number of times a
given word or phrase appeared! This also applies to both offered
**derivatives**, because they are completely impervious to localized averaging.

<details>
<summary>**Historical note**</summary>

In a prior version of ilo Muni, smoothing would be performed over all neighbors
of a value, even if those neighbors were zero. This is intended behavior if
those zeroes appear in the middle of an otherwise busy graph, but this causes
some misleading graphs when a word had no data from the start of a graphed
period. Smoothing such a graph could
[**imply that misikeke existed before November 2019**](/?query=misikeke&smoothing=10&smoother=gauss).
This was fixed on August 13th; now, smoothing does not occur until the first
non-zero element of a graph.

### Dates

<EpochRangePicker
  startYear={EARLIEST_YEAR}
  endYear={LATEST_YEAR}
  startValueYear={2016}
  startId="startDropdown"
  endId="endDropdown"
  renderAs="date"
/>

By default, the date range for the graph is set from **2016** to **2025**. You
can select any start or end you want, but there are some caveats to warn you
about:

1. Each year represents **August** of that year until **August** of the next
   year. This is done intentionally, to align annual measurements of toki pona
   with the day toki pona was created, 2001-08-08. This is why, if you select
   **2016**, the graph will start in August and mark 2017 shortly after.

2. Each datapoint represents a month of activity, regardless of the length of
   the represented month. This means that datapoints for different months are
   not necessarily comparable on [the absolute scale](#absolute). For example:
   If there were more activity in May compared to February, you wouldn't be able
   to tell if there were a specific cause for that change- the change could be
   accounted for by the month of May being longer. This issue could be corrected
   for by using same-sized units of time for each datapoint, but this creates
   more problems than it solves. See the historical note in this section for
   more information.

3. The default start date is **2016** because the data prior to that is
   extremely sparse. I have left in the option to query for earlier data, but be
   aware that relative graphs will be noisy, the absolute graphs will be flat,
   minmax graphs will become nonsense- and for the other graphs, here be
   dragons.

4. The graph ends in July 2024. There is no data provided for August 2024 or
   beyond, because I only wanted to represent completed months in ilo Muni, and
   I collected this data during August 2024.

<details>
<summary>**Historical note**</summary>

The database dated 2024-09-07, which was available on ilo Muni from 2024-09-12
to 2024-12-17, does not use monthly buckets of data. Instead, it uses 4-weekly
buckets of data, with the 4-weekly period starting from 2001-08-08. The purpose
of this was to solve the following problem:

> Some months are shorter than others, so [the absolute scale](#absolute) may be
> misleading for those periods by implying they were less active than
> neighboring months. Relatedly, days of the week are not evenly distributed
> over months, so some months will have more weekends and therefore more active
> periods than others. 4-weekly buckets solves both of these problems at once.

By switching to 4-weekly periods for ilo Muni's data, the represented periods of
time were now all the same size. This made datapoints in the absolute graph
directly comparable, but it also meant that the user interface was obnoxious:
Each datapoint would be labeled with an exact day, implying it represented only
that day, when it actually represented that day _and_ the following four week
period. The given date couldn't be rounded to a month since that 4-weekly period
could cross months, and even if I had changed it to a range, there would have
been that much more interpretation complexity for an incredibly minor, single
gain.

All of this said, [the relative scale](#relative) was never affected in the
first place. It represents datapoints as a percentage of the words said- this
corrects for the differing totals you may get on a month to month basis.

As of 2024-12-17, I have switched back to monthly buckets.

### Minimum Sentence Length

**Note**: This is hidden by default! Click <Icon name="mingcute:tool-line" /> to
show it.

<IntDropdown
  options={LENGTHS}
  singularText="All sentences"
  pluralText="+ words per sentence"
  id="sentLenDropdown"
/>

This option is also called **words per sentence** in its dropdown. By default,
**All sentences** is set, meaning you will see how words or phrases appear in
any length of sentence. If you set this option to **3+ words per sentence**,
you'll see how words or phrases appear in sentences which have **at least 3
words**. This can be helpful if you want to study more "substantial" uses of
words, i.e. those that appear in longer sentences.

If one of your searches
[sets the minimum sentence length for a term](#set-minimum-sentence-length), pay
attention to the legend below the graph: If the legend shows the term without an
underscore, it means the length you chose was already being searched. This can
happen with a search like [**toki pona_2**](/?query=toki+pona_2) normally, or
[**wawa_3**](/?query=wawa_3&minSentLen=3) while the minimum sentence length
dropdown is set to 3.

This happens to the phrase **toki pona** with a minimum sentence length of 2
because phrases have a minimum sentence length equal to how many words are in
them. That is, "toki pona" can only appear in sentences with at least two words-
which I hope makes sense! Because of this, the minimum sentence length is always
implicitly set to at least the length of the phrase. You can always set it to be
higher, of course.

Note that when graphing on any **relative scale**, the percentage is derived by
dividing the number of occurrences for the search term by the total number of
words in the same time period.

If you're curious why this is done instead of dividing by the number of words in
sentences of the appropriate minimum length, here's a simplified example:

<details>
<summary>**Demonstration**</summary>

Imagine the following scenario:

- There are 10,000 words in total
- 9,000 of those words are in sentences with at least 2 words
- 100 of the words are **toki**
- 90 of those **toki** are in sentences with at least 2 words

With this data, asking "What percentage of words are toki?" means we get 1% (100
/ 10,000), which makes sense, and this is the only reasonable question to
measure toki on its own.

However, there are two ways to measure toki in sentences with at least 2 words
(**toki_2**): You could measure it as a portion of all words, or as a portion of
words from sentences with at least 2 words. These two different choices have
different results: **toki_2** is **0.9%** (90 / 10,000) of all words, but **1%**
(90 / 9,000) of the words in sentences with at least 2 words.

We can use this information to determine which answer is best for this graphing
tool by exploring what happens when you search **toki - toki_2**.

In the sample data, graphing **toki - toki_2** with toki_2 measured as a portion
of all words means we get **0.1%**: ((100 - 90) / 10,000). That is, toki appears
exactly 10 times on its own in this data. Graphing instead with **toki_2**
measured as a portion of words in sentences with 2 or more words means we get
**0%**: ((100 / 10,000) - (90 / 9,000)). In other words, we get a misleading
outcome because we're subtracting two incomparable percentages.

There is value in knowing what portion of sentences with at least 2 words are
some specific word. This graphing tool does not offer that information because
doing so would produce misleading graphs for both side-by-side comparison and
for adding or subtracting specific results. If you're interested in that
alternate data,

### Smoother

**Note**: This is hidden by default! Click <Icon name="mingcute:tool-line" /> to
show it.

<CategorizedDropdown
  id="smootherDropdown"
  options={SMOOTHERS}
  selected={defaultSmoother}
/>

By default, **Window Avg** is set, and I don't recommend changing it from the
default unless you're aware of what change you're making and why. The different
smoothers have different properties, but almost all of them boil down to making
the data more readable when the month-to-month values are messy.

#### Gaussian

The **Gaussian** smoother is the default smoother as of 2024-12-17. It makes
highly smooth and presentable curves, and does a better job of preserving the
locations of peaks and troughs than either Window Average or Exponential.

#### Window Avg

The **Window Avg** smoother was previously the default smoother, and is the only
one offered by Google Ngrams. It averages the neighbors of a given point, which
will flatten the graph toward a smoother one with the same characteristic curve
as the original noisy data, but preserving a bit of the noise along the way. In
data with high peaks, you'll notice a
[characteristic plateau shape](/?query=suno+pi+toki+pona&smoothing=3&smoother=cwin)
form around where the peak would be. With extremely high smoothing, all of the
data will
[tend toward a flat line](/?query=toki%2C+pona%2C+toki+pona&smoothing=50&smoother=cwin)
as all datapoints are set to the average of the entire graph, although data with
regular peaks will exhibit
[phantom peaks](/ilo-muni?query=suno+pi+toki+pona&smoothing=7&smoother=cwin)
with sufficiently high smoothing.

#### Exponential

The **Exponential** smoother preserves the curve of activity while moving peaks
and troughs closer to the average of their neighbors. This is helpful for
preserving the occurrence of large peaks, but it does smear them forward in time
due to weighting later events more heavily than earlier ones.

#### Median

The **median** smoother finds the median of every value in the smoothing window,
which results in a very square-looking graph. It occasionally exhibits the same
[phantom peaks](/ilo-muni?query=suno+pi+toki+pona&smoothing=7&smoother=med) as
Window Average

#### Triangular

## Potential Bias

In previous sections, I discussed how [smoothing](#smoothing) can create
misleading graphs, and how the math works for
[phrases with 2 or more words](#relative)
to create a consistent interpretation across the dataset. However, these are not
the only interpretation challenges. Most of the remaining bias is in where and
how the data is collected, which I describe the specifics of below.

{/* and [words as they appear in sentences with a minimum length](#minimum-sentence-length) */}

### Bots

Every platform has bots which send messages, but not every platform is gracious
enough to inform you that a given message is from a bot. Fortunately, almost no
bots are sending messages in toki pona, but there are a handful worth being
aware of because they artificially increase the use of any word or phrase they
use if counted.

#### Discord

Discord does an excellent job of informing you that a given user is a bot, but
things get mixed up when it comes to webhooks because of
[PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/). Normally, webhooks are a kind of bot message
which is sent automatically but is not attached to any user. They tend to be
notifications for things happening on other platforms, like commits on Github or
posts on Reddit. However, PluralKit messages are webhook messages from users.
Right now, I can't distinguish between PluralKit messages and any other type of
webhook, so I'm forced to count both or neither- and I chose to count both. This
means there is some uncertain amount of bot data in the Discord data.
Fortunately, only 4.6% of the data is from webhooks, so the impact of this
cannot be _too_ large.

In the future, I plan to grab all the webhook messages I have and ask the
PluralKit API whether those messages are PluralKit messages. Then I would be
able to map those messages back to the host account which originally sent the
message, and I could then count only user messages.

#### Telegram

On Telegram, I have no way to know if a given user is a bot. Telegram's JSON
export format does not include that information. I do have one hard-coded
exception, the IRC forwarding bot, because I needed to cut the names out of its
messages to represent them as intended. Otherwise, all Telegram bots are
invisible to me. That said, all of the ones I've seen speak English, so they
shouldn't have any counted sentences.

#### Reddit

Reddit does not tell you if a given user is a bot as far as I'm aware. Can't fix
it, but like Telegram, none of the bots on Reddit seem to speak toki pona- so no
harm done!

### Herbevitistoj

Herbevitistoj is "Many people who professionally avoid grass." It's a fairly
recent and silly way that
[Esperanto speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) refer to the
"terminally online," or termed more kindly, people who are on the internet a
lot. Most toki pona is spoken on the internet in the first place, but there is
still a subset of the community which makes up an outsized portion of messages
written in toki pona because they are much more active in online spaces. There
isn't anything to be done about this- it's just a fact to be aware of.

That said, I am personally curious to see what the data would look like if the
most active 20% of users were removed from it- maybe something to do in the
future.

### Platform Notes

No notes for Telegram, Reddit, YouTube, or the Toki Pona forums; all of them are
represented in their entirety, or as much entirety as can be reasonably
obtained, through the final represented date of ilo Muni.

#### Discord

Right now, the data for ilo Muni is collected from Discord, Telegram, and
Reddit. Of these, Discord is about 80% of all of the data, and
[ma pona pi toki pona](https://discord.gg/mapona) in particular is about 80% of
the data from Discord. You can see the impact of that one server from sections
of the graph
[like this](/?query=toki,+pona&minSentLen=1&scale=abs&start=1627776000&end=1722470400),
where a small number of archived channels caused a nearly 50% decline in use of
toki pona.

In a sense, Discord is "over-represented" in the data, because it is such a
large portion of the data in the first place. For the time being, I have chosen
to weight all messages equally, but I would like to produce alternate databases
and analyses in the future.

### Identifying toki pona

This data would not exist without first being able to detect whether a message
is "in toki pona". I wrote [a library](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-toki) to
do this, but it has its own collection of complexities which can impact how you
interpret the data.

I chose to use the dictionary from [lipu Linku](https://linku.la), including its
[sandbox](https://linku.la/sandbox), in order to to identify definite "toki pona
words." These weren't the only words I counted, because that would miss anything
that weren't already in my dictionary. But it still isn't perfect.

#### Dictionary

If a word in my dictionary matches a word in another language, I would errantly
count that word while scoring the sentence. My scoring algorithm has no concept
of a penalty currently, so I couldn't identify that the words around a given one
were specifically of some language other than toki pona- I'd just know they
didn't match any of my filters.

This is especially troublesome if a message is a single word in my dictionary,
or otherwise very short. "je" is borderline non-existent in toki pona, but it's
in the dictionary, and it's a first person pronoun in French!

#### Short words

While writing my sentence scoring algorithm, I noticed that there were tons of
1-2 letter words in other languages which would errantly match my scoring
filter, and thus errantly raise the score of messages that were not in toki
pona.

To fix this, I changed my syllable checking and alphabetic match checking
filters to only score if a given word has at least three letters.

For the most part, this is a good assumption: two letter words are rare enough
that I almost certainly have them all in my dictionary already. Doubly so for
one letter words, since there are only six possible (a, e, i, o, u, n).

But this means that, if a two letter word were coined, and it were not added to
my dictionary, I would score it zero by default- it could still be discovered if
it were next to many other toki pona words, but it would drag down the score of
the sentence it's in.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does [query] take so long?

While searching for one or a few terms should only take about half a second,
searching with a wildcard or for many terms will take much longer- you can
estimate this by multiplying the half second by the number of queries you're
making.

That said, all queries will become faster as you make more queries in the same
session. This is because you're downloading and caching more of the database's
data!

But this is limited by the fact that each part of each query must be fetched
consecutively, including for different queries. There is only one worker
fetching data, because multiple workers would be unable to share their cache.

If I had a database hosting solution, nearly all of the queries would be as
instant as the network itself. If you have any suggestions for one,
[let me know!](https://github.com/gregdan3/issues/new)

### Why is my subtraction negative?

That's allowed! If you do
[**tawa pona - kama pona**](ilo-muni/?query=tawa+pona+-+kama+pona), you'll get a
graph which is mostly negative. This means the phrase "kama pona" is more common
than the phrase "tawa pona", probably because the community is very welcoming!

It's _probably_ possible to get floating point silliness when subtracting, but I
haven't seen that happen personally-
[please reach out if you spot it](https://github.com/gregdan3/issues/new)!

### Why is the data so noisy before 2020?

In short, there is much less data to examine from before 2020, and even less
before 2017. This is why I set the default start date to August 2016, rather
than the actual start of the data in March 2002. For reference, this roughly
aligns to the creation of the first toki pona groups on Telegram.

So the next question is, why 2020? Although I probably don't need to answer
that, I'll go ahead and do so:

When everyone was trapped indoors for some two years during the COVID-19
pandemic, toki pona saw a huge spike in popularity. You can see the climb in
activity in every word when the scale is set to "absolute". This also affects
the relative graph though- before 2020, each word written is a much larger
portion of all the words for that time period! To help, you can add smoothing to
relative mode, which will average out nearby data points and thus make the data
easier to read while preserving its original shape.

### Why is there a huge spike on [date] for [word]?

This data isn't from "professional" sources, unlike Google Ngrams which is
sourced entirely from published books. In "professional" sources, you wouldn't
expect an editor to let a paragraph like **woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah! woo
yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah!** remain in the final product. Usually. But in Discord
and any other social media platform, there is no editorial oversight- silly
goofy abounds.

Sometimes this means you'll see a word organically spike in usage, because it
was just made and people are excited to use it! Other times, you'll see a word
spike in usage due to a word game being played, which I try to identify and
omit. After all, the purpose of ilo Muni is to measure "real" toki pona, and
word games fall _just_ outside of this bound.

This used to affect mu, wan, tu, luka, mute, and ale, but I've since removed
those- that was from a single person counting from 1 to over 2,000 all on their
own over the course of a day!

Relatedly, there was a time during development where "mu" had a spike to **over
40,000 uses** because of a day in which a handful of messages were nothing but
"mu" to the text limit of Discord. Because of this, I added a nonsense filter to
skip sentences before they get counted, which works like so: If a sentence is
more than 5x the **average sentence length (4.13557)** and more than 50% of the
message is a single word, it gets thrown out. Similarly, if a sentence is more
than 25x the average sentence length, it gets thrown out immediately. This
filter isn't perfect though, because somebody can say "mu. mu. mu." to similar
effect, and each of those will be counted as individual sentences. Working on
it!

Ultimately, I would like this data to reflect how toki pona is actually used-
and, granted, somebody sending hundreds of "mu" is using toki pona. But I think
most people would agree that those messages are not reflective of how toki pona
is used in either media or conversation, and these sorts of sentences otherwise
make it difficult to examine the rest of the data.

### Why is do hits and authors drop so much between Feb and Aug 2023?

Because at the time, the mod team of **ma pona pi toki pona** (including
myself!), chose to archive half of the channels in the toki pona only category
of the server! In retrospect, this idea was doomed from the start, but we didn't
know why at the time.

At the time, we were observing a very consistent pattern in the toki pona
channels of the server, in the form of the following conversation:

> (10:31) jan Wan: toki!
>
> (10:39) jan Tu: toki, sina pilin seme?
>
> (11:04) jan Wan: mi pilin pona. sina pilin seme?

In short, somebody would say "hello," but not get a response very quickly. They
would wander off, eventually see that somebody else responsed, but their own
response would be too late to catch them. No conversation would actually occur.

We saw this pattern playing out so frequently that we decided to try and help
it, and we diagnosed the issue as there being too many channels- people were not
seeing one another because they had too many channels to dig through to find
conversation. So we archived **most of the channels which had a built-in
topic.**

We chose to restore the archived channels that August, but we wouldn't actually
see the results of this change until **July 2024** when I began creating the
first graphs with ilo Muni. When I realized the connection between **The Dip**
and the archived channels, I realized what we were missing at the time:
Conversations for their own sake aren't enough. Conversations have a topic, and
that topic is what drives longer discussion. Even if people see each other more
often, they won't talk if there is nothing to talk about- and we left behind
only the general discussion channels, with no set topic.

For comparison, the topic channels were always much quieter than the general
channels- but what they lacked in activity, they made up for in conversation
depth, because those channels offered something obvious to talk about from the
start.

Anyway, the effect of this period of time is a drop in the number of words used
_and_ a drop in the number of active authors for any given word. It doesn't
affect the percentage of words used in that period, which is expected- the
porportions of used words should not change. But it _does_ affect the percentage
of authors significantly- this is because many authors stuck around, but still
ended up speaking much less toki pona. Unlike relative hits, relative authors do
not exist in competition- one author may use any number of words, including
fewer, without affecting the total number of authors for a given period.
